# Build a Website UI with Figma

- **Pre-workshop activities**: 10 mins  
- **Introductory presentation**: 10 mins  
- **Hands-on activities**: 60 mins  

## What is Figma?

[Figma](https://www.figma.com) is a cloud-based design tool that allows you to create **user interfaces (UI)** for websites, apps, and digital products. It's popular among web designers because of its collaborative features, ease of use, and flexibility for creating responsive designs.

Even if you've never used a design tool before, Figma's **beginner-friendly** interface will help you quickly get started on your first website project. 

## What Are We Building?  

In this workshop, we are designing a **portfolio website for a fictional fashion designer**. Through this project, you’ll learn how to create a visually stunning and interactive UI that showcases a designer’s work in an elegant and professional layout.  

By the end of this workshop, you will have built a **fully designed and interactive website UI** in Figma. Below is the final design you will work towards:    

### **Home Page**

### **Portfolio Page**

### **About Me Page**  
<img src="images/about-final.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="Final About Me Page Design">  


## Learning Objectives

This workshop is designed for beginners interested in learning **UI design principles** and how to use Figma to create a **basic website layout**.

By the end of this workshop, you will:

- Understand the basic tools and features in **Figma**  
- Create a simple **website layout** using **frames, grids, and components** 
- Apply **typography, colors, and images** to your design  
- Build an **interactive prototype** of your website  
- Share your design with others for feedback and handoff

 ## Stop Fighting with Templates. Start Designing.

You are here because you have a project, a portfolio, or an idea, and you want it to look professional. Today, we are not just learning "buttons" and "menus"—we are learning how to translate your academic identity into a digital format.

By the end of this session, you will have a **fully interactive prototype** of a personal portfolio website.

### 🏁 The Goal
We are building a **Desktop Portfolio Homepage** featuring:
* A responsive Navigation Bar.
* A "Hero" section (your intro).
* A Project Grid (your work).
* Interactive Links (clicking between pages).

### ⚡️ Why Figma?
Unlike Canva (which is for images) or PowerPoint (which is for slides), Figma is for **Interfaces**. It is how the actual internet is built. Learning this gives you a superpower: you can prototype *anything*.

### 🎒 Pre-requisites
1.  **Account:** A free [Figma account](https://www.figma.com/).
2.  **App:** Ideally, download the Desktop App, but the browser works too.
3.  **Assets:** Have 1-2 photos of yourself or your work ready on your desktop.
