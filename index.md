# Build a Website UI with Figma

- **Pre-workshop activities**: 10 mins  
- **Introductory presentation**: 10 mins  
- **Hands-on activities**: 60 mins  

## What is Figma?

[Figma](https://www.figma.com) is a cloud-based design tool that allows you to create **user interfaces (UI)** for websites, apps, and digital products. It's popular among web designers because of its collaborative features, ease of use, and flexibility for creating responsive designs.

Even if you've never used a design tool before, Figma's **beginner-friendly** interface will help you quickly get started on your first website project. 

## What Are We Building?  

In this workshop, we are designing a **portfolio website for a fictional fashion designer**. Yes, sadly, **Evelyne Stark does not exist** (but let’s be honest, it would be pretty cool if she did). Through this project, you’ll learn how to create a visually stunning and interactive UI that showcases a designer’s work in an elegant and professional layout.  

By the end of this workshop, you will have built a **fully designed and interactive website UI** in Figma. Below is the final design you will work towards:
