# Sharing Your Figma Design  

Now that you’ve completed your design, it’s time to share it with others! Whether you want feedback, collaboration, or just to showcase your design, Figma makes sharing easy.  


## 1. Opening the Share Menu  

1. Ensure you have the **Figma file** open.  
2. In the **top-right corner**, click the **Share** button.  


## 2. Adjusting Access & Permissions  

When sharing, you can control **who can view or edit** your design:  

1. In the **Share** pop-up, enter the **email address** of the person you want to share with.  
2. Click on the **dropdown menu** next to their name and select the appropriate access level:  
   - **Can View** → Allows them to only view the design.  
   - **Can Edit** → Grants permission to make changes.  

Alternatively, you can generate a **link** to share:  
1. Click **Copy Prototype Link** near the bottom of the Share pop-up to share a view-only presentation of your Figma design.
2. Click **Copy Dev Mode Link** to share an editable version of your Figma design. Note your collaborator will need to make an account and also request permission to edit which will be at the bottom of the screen in blue.   


## 3. Presenting Your Design  

If you want to **present your design like a real website**, use **Prototype Mode**:  

1. Click the **Play (▶) button** in the top-right corner to launch the prototype.  
2. Share the prototype link by clicking **Share Prototype** in the preview window.  



## 4. Exporting Your Design  

Want to save your design as an image or PDF? Here’s how:  

1. Select the **frame or element** you want to export.  
2. In the **Right Sidebar**, scroll down to **Export** and click **+**.  
3. Choose a file format:  
   - **PNG** (for high-quality images)  
   - **JPG** (for compressed images)  
   - **SVG** (for scalable vector graphics)
