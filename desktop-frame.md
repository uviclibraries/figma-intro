# Working with Frames  

If you and your group have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance. Have fun!  

## 1. Creating a Desktop Frame  

In Figma, **Frames** act as containers for your designs and help structure your layout. Let’s start by adding a **Desktop Frame** to your canvas.  

1. Make sure you are in your **Figma Design File**.  
2. In the **Top Toolbar**, click on the **Frame Tool** (Shortcut: Press **F**).  
3. On the **Right Sidebar**, a list of preset frame sizes will appear.  
4. Scroll down and click on the **Desktop** dropdown, then select the **Desktop** option to create a standard desktop-sized frame.  
5. Your new frame will appear on the canvas. Make sure it is selected before moving to the next step.  
6. With the frame selected, go to the **Layers Panel** on the left.  
7. Double-click on the frame name (default should be "Desktop - 1") and rename it to **"Home"**. Press **Enter** to confirm.

## 2. Applying a Linear Gradient Background  

Now, let’s style the frame with a **linear gradient background**.  

1. In the **Layers Panel** (on the left sidebar), find and select the "Home" Frame to ensure it's active.  
2. In the **Right Sidebar**, locate the **Fill** section under **Design**.  
3. Click on the **color box** to open the color picker.  
4. In the color picker, click on the **square icon with dots within** to switch from a solid color to a gradient fill.

5. Two color stops will appear on the gradient bar:  
   - Click on the **first color stop** (top of the gradient) and enter the HEX code: **#5A452D**.  
   - Click on the **second color stop** (bottom of the gradient) and enter the HEX code: **#C4A484**. 6. Click on the **first color stop** (top of the gradient) and enter the HEX code: **#5A452D**.  
8. Ensure that the gradient line on the frame goes from top to bottom
