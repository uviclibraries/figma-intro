# Pre-Workshop Activities

Before we start building your website design in Figma, there are a few setup steps to complete to ensure you're ready for the hands-on activities.

1.  **Create a Figma Account**  
If you donâ€™t have a Figma account yet, go to [figma.com](https://www.figma.com) and sign up for a **free account**.  
Once your account is created, you can use **Figma in your browser** or download the **Figma desktop app**.
<br/>

2.  **Install the Figma Desktop App (Optional)**  
While Figma works great in your browser, you can also download the **desktop app** for Windows or Mac.  
Download it from: [figma.com/downloads](https://www.figma.com/downloads)
