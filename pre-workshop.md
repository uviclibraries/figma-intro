# Pre-Workshop Activities

Before we start building your website design in Figma, there are a few setup steps to complete to ensure you're ready for the hands-on activities.

1.  **Create a Figma Account**  
If you don't have a Figma account yet, go to [figma.com](https://www.figma.com) and sign up for a **free account**.  
Once your account is created, you can use **Figma in your browser** or download the **Figma desktop app**.
<br/>

2. **Download the Icons & Images for Prototyping**  
For this session, we'll be using a set of icons and images to build our prototype. [Click here](https://uviclibraries.github.io/figma-intro/resources/figma-intro-resources.zip) to download these resources. Once downloaded, unzip the file to access the assets. You're also free to use your own images to personalize your design.  
<br/>

3.  **Install the Figma Desktop App (Optional)** 
While Figma works great in your browser, you can also download the **desktop app** for Windows or Mac.  
Download it from: [figma.com/downloads](https://www.figma.com/downloads)
