# Challenge: Design the About Me Page

You’ve learned how to structure sections, place images, and create simple navigation. Now it’s time to apply those skills without step-by-step hand-holding (because the real world doesn’t come with it either).

Your task: **recreate the About Me page layout** shown below using the same principles you used in the previous pages.

## What the Final Design Should Look Like

Before you start, study the layout and notice:
- the **grid/alignment**
- the **spacing**
- the **text hierarchy** (big headline → smaller body text)
- the **visual balance** (image weight vs text weight)

<img src="images/about-final.jpg" style="width:80%; max-width:900px; border:1px solid #ddd; border-radius:8px;" alt="Final About Me Page Design">

## What You Need (Assets)

All required icons and images are included in the assets you downloaded in **Pre-Workshop Activities (Step 2)**.
- If you can’t find them, re-download the zip from the Pre-Workshop page.
- Keep your assets organized (don’t drag random files onto the canvas and hope for the best).

## Requirements (Don’t Skip These)

Your About Me page must include:
1. **A page title / heading** (clear and larger than body text)
2. **A profile image or hero image**
3. **At least 2 short paragraphs** (body text)
4. **At least 2 icons** (or small supporting visuals)
5. **A clear navigation element** (button or link style) that matches your other pages

## Tips (So This Doesn’t Turn Into Chaos)

- **Use Frames, not Rectangles** for main page structure.
- **Group related elements** (image + caption, icon + text, etc.).
- **Align everything** (use Figma’s smart guides and alignment tools).
- **Keep spacing consistent** (don’t eyeball it wildly).
- **Use 2 font sizes max** for simplicity (headline + body).
- Optional (advanced): try **Auto Layout** for a clean stacked section.

## Checkpoint: You’re Done When…

Use this checklist before moving on:
- [ ] Text is aligned and readable
- [ ] Spacing looks consistent across sections
- [ ] Icons/images are not stretched or pixelated
- [ ] The page looks visually balanced (not top-heavy or empty)
- [ ] Navigation is clear and matches your design system

## Common Mistakes (Fix These Fast)

- **Everything is misaligned:** select multiple layers and use Align tools.
- **Text is hard to read:** add contrast (darker overlay / lighter text).
- **Images look warped:** check constraints and use proper scaling (don’t drag corners without holding Shift unless intended).
- **You lost layers:** rename key layers (Header, Body, Icons, Buttons).

### What's Next?

Once your About Me page is complete, the final step is learning how to **share your finished Figma design**, so others can view and interact with it.
