# Challenge: Design the About Me Page (15 minutes)

This is where you stop following instructions and start making decisions like a designer.

## Timebox
You get **15 minutes**:
- 2 min: plan layout
- 10 min: build
- 3 min: prototype + cleanup

## Goal
Recreate an About Me page that matches your design system:
- Same header/nav style as your other pages
- Clear typography hierarchy
- Balanced layout (not a wall of text)

## Required sections (must include all)
1) **Header**
- Reuse your header style (logo/title + nav links)

2) **Hero / Intro**
- A profile image (or placeholder shape)
- Name/title line
- Short bio paragraph (3–5 lines)

3) **Skills / Focus Area**
- 3–6 items (icons optional)
- Use consistent spacing and alignment

4) **Call to Action**
- A button (Contact / View Work / Download CV)
- Make it visually obvious

## Build plan (do this in order)
### Step 1: Duplicate a page to reuse structure
Duplicate your Home or Portfolio frame and rename it **About Me**.
This keeps the header consistent and saves time.

### Step 2: Block layout first (no details)
Draw 3 large rectangles as layout placeholders:
- Hero block
- Skills block
- CTA block
Then replace rectangles with real content.

### Step 3: Add content + spacing rules
- Align everything to a consistent left margin
- Use spacing increments (e.g., 16 / 24 / 32)
- Rename your key layers (Header / Hero / Skills / CTA)

### Step 4: Prototype the nav
In **Prototype** tab:
- Link **About Me** in your header to this frame
- Link **Home** back to Home frame
- Test in Present mode

## Checkpoint (you’re done when)
- [ ] Text is readable and aligned
- [ ] Spacing is consistent across sections
- [ ] Header looks like the same “site” as your other pages
- [ ] At least **one prototype link** navigates correctly

## Peer review (2 minutes)
Swap with a partner (or self-check brutally):
- What’s the first thing your eye sees? (Should be the headline, not random clutter)
- Is there any “almost aligned” spacing? Fix it.
- Do sections feel grouped? If not, add spacing or dividers.

## Extensions (for fast finishers)
- Add an icon row with Auto Layout
- Add a subtle background shape or gradient panel behind the hero section
- Add a Smart Animate transition for page navigation
