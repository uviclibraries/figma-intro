# 0) Figma Scavenger Hunt (5 minutes)

{: .note }
This is the “stop being scared of the interface” step. If you skip this, you’ll spend the next 30 minutes lost in zoom hell.

## Goal
In **5 minutes**, prove you can do the basic moves in Figma without hand-holding.

## Instructions
Open your workshop file (or create a new Design File). Complete every task below.

### Task List (do all of them)
- [ ] **Create a Frame** (press **F**) and pick a Desktop preset (or draw one). Rename it **Home**.
- [ ] Add a **Rectangle** (press **R**), change its fill color, and rename it **Hero BG**.
- [ ] Add **Text** (press **T**) that says `Hello Figma`. Change font size. Rename it **Headline**.
- [ ] Select two layers and **Align** them (left/center). (Any alignment, just do it on purpose.)
- [ ] Select 2–3 elements and press **Shift + A** to apply **Auto Layout** (yes, even if it looks ugly).
- [ ] Switch to **Prototype** tab and create **one link**: click → navigate to another frame (duplicate Home if needed).

## Checkpoint (you’re done when)
- Your Layers panel has **meaningful names** (not Rectangle 91).
- You can zoom/pan and find your frame again.
- You have **at least one** working prototype link.

## If you get stuck (fast fixes)
- Lost your canvas? Use **Shift + 0** (Zoom to Fit).
- Can’t select an object? Check the **Layers** panel and click it there.
- Auto Layout “ruined” your layout? Good. That means it’s working. Undo once and reselect the correct parent group.
