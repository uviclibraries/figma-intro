# Figma Introduction
### UVic Libraries Digital Scholarship Commons

**A beginner-friendly workshop for students, faculty, and staff.**

## 🎯 Workshop Objective
Most academic professionals need to present their work online, but tools like Photoshop can be overkill and template builders can feel limiting. This workshop teaches the **core essentials of Figma** (an industry-standard design tool) by guiding participants through building a **clickable, professional portfolio website prototype** in **under 90 minutes**.

## 🎓 Who This Is For
- **Undergrads/Grads:** Showcasing research, projects, and portfolios
- **Faculty:** Creating lab or course website layouts, visual abstracts, figures
- **Library Staff:** Designing digital exhibits, guides, posters, and web visuals
- **Skill Level:** Absolute beginner (no design experience required)

## 🛠 What We Will Build
We’ll build a simple multi-page portfolio prototype and learn the fundamentals behind good UI structure:
1. **Digital layout:** Frames vs. Rectangles, alignment, spacing, and hierarchy
2. **Typography & color:** Building a consistent, readable academic style
3. **Prototyping:** Making buttons actually navigate between pages
4. **Exporting:** Preparing assets for development or no-code workflows

## ✅ What You Need
- A free **Figma** account (browser-based)
- A laptop (Chrome recommended)
- Optional: a few images (headshot, logo, project screenshots)

## 🚀 How to Use This Workshop
This material is designed for live instruction, but it also works for self-paced learning.
