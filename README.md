# Figma Introduction
### UVic Libraries Digital Scholarship Commmons

**A course for students, faculty, and staff.**

## 🎯 Workshop Objective
Most academic professionals need to present their work online but find tools like Photoshop too complex and template builders too limiting. This workshop teaches the **essentials of Figma**—the industry-standard interface design tool—by building a clickable, professional portfolio website from scratch in under 90 minutes.

## 🎓 Who This Is For
* **Undergrads/Grads:** Showcasing research and projects.
* **Faculty:** Creating lab websites or course materials.
* **Library Staff:** Designing digital exhibits or guides.
* **Skill Level:** Absolute Beginner (No design experience required).

## 🛠 What We Will Build
We will move beyond "drag and drop" and learn how the web actually works:
1.  **Digital Layout:** Understanding Frames vs. Rectangles.
2.  **Typography & Color:** Setting up a consistent academic brand.
3.  **Prototyping:** Making buttons actually click and navigate.
4.  **Exporting:** Getting assets ready for development (or no-code tools).

## 🚀 Usage
This material is designed to be followed alongside a live instructor, but can be used for self-paced learning.
