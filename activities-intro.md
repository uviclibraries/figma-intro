# Hands-On Activities Introduction

{: .note }
If you’re attending a live workshop, you can skim this page and move on. If you’re self-paced, read it once and then start building.

## What we’re building
You’ll build a simple **portfolio website UI** with:
- Home page (header + hero)
- Portfolio page (project cards)
- About Me page (challenge)
Then you’ll make it **clickable** with prototypes.

## Rules (so this workshop actually works)
- Presentation is **15 minutes max**.
- After that, you will be building the whole time.
- Every section includes a **variation task** so you’re not just copying.

## Your success checklist
Before you start, confirm:
- You’re logged into Figma
- You can create/open a file
- You can see the **Layers** panel (left) and **Properties** panel (right)

## Keyboard shortcuts you’ll use (minimum viable)
| Action | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| Frame | **F** |
| Text | **T** |
| Rectangle | **R** |
| Auto Layout | **Shift + A** |
| Duplicate | **Cmd/Ctrl + D** |
| Zoom to Fit | **Shift + 0** |
