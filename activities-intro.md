# Hands-On Activities Introduction

{: .note }
If you're attending a live workshop, you can skip this page and continue to the next step.

If you're doing this **self-paced**, take 3–5 minutes to complete these quick setup items before starting the activities.

---

## 1) Review the Intro Slides (3–5 min)

These slides explain the big idea behind UI design and why we’re using Figma.

- Read the [Introductory Slides](resources/figma-intro-slides.pdf){:target="_blank"}

{: .important }
Some older slide examples may reference a specific persona/story. Ignore that. Your workshop build is a **generic academic portfolio prototype**.

## 2) Resize Your Laptop Screen (2 min)

This helps you follow along with handouts and keep Figma visible while working.

<div style="max-width: 720px; margin: 12px 0;">
  <iframe width="100%" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Igk5hZUfzN0"
    title="Resize Your Laptop Screen for Workshop Handouts"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

If the video doesn’t load, open it directly:

## 3) Quick Readiness Check (30 seconds)

Before you proceed, make sure:
- You’re logged into Figma in your browser
- You can create/open a file
- You can see the **Layers panel (left)** and **Properties panel (right)**
