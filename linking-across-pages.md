# Linking Pages with Smart Animate  

**Why Link Pages?**  
Linking pages in Figma allows you to create a **clickable prototype** that simulates user flow, helping you visualize and test your design before final development. Adding **Smart Animate** transitions enhances this experience by animating elements between frames, giving your prototype a polished, professional feel.  


## 1. Selecting the Home Frame  

1. In the **Layers Panel**, find and select the **Home Frame**.  
2. Switch to **Prototype Mode** by clicking the **Prototype** tab in the right sidebar.  



## 2. Creating a Link from the Portfolio Navigation Element  

1. On the **Home Frame**, locate the **Portfolio** text in your header navigation.  
2. Click on it, then drag the **blue circle** (interaction handle) to the **Portfolio Frame**.  
3. In the **Prototype Settings** panel that appears:  
   - **Interaction**: On Click  
   - **Navigate To**: Portfolio Frame  
   - **Animation**: Smart Animate  
   - **Easing**: Ease In Out *(or your preferred easing)*  
   - **Duration**: 300ms *(or your preferred timing)*  



## 3. Linking the "My Portfolio" Button  

1. Still on the **Home Frame**, select the **"My Portfolio"** button.  
2. Drag the **blue circle** to the **Portfolio Frame**.  
3. In the **Prototype Settings** panel:  
   - **Interaction**: On Click  
   - **Navigate To**: Portfolio Frame  
   - **Animation**: Smart Animate  
   - **Easing**: Ease In Out  
   - **Duration**: 300ms  


## 4. Creating a Link Back to the Home Page  

1. Switch to the **Portfolio Frame** in the **Layers Panel**.  
2. In **Prototype Mode**, select the **Home** text in the header navigation.  
3. Drag the **blue circle** to the **Home Frame**.  
4. In the **Prototype Settings** panel:  
   - **Interaction**: On Click  
   - **Navigate To**: Home Frame  
   - **Animation**: Smart Animate  
   - **Easing**: Ease In Out  
   - **Duration**: 300ms  


## 5. Testing Your Prototype  

1. Click the **Present** button (▶) in the top-right corner of Figma.  
2. Navigate through the links:  
   - **Home** → **Portfolio**  
   - **My Portfolio** → **Portfolio**  
   - **Home** (on Portfolio Page) → **Home** Frame  
3. Observe the **Smart Animate** transitions and confirm the navigation flow feels smooth.  


Now that your pages are linked with smooth **Smart Animate transitions**, the next step is designing the **About Me Page**, where we will introduce Evelyne with structured sections and interactive elements.
