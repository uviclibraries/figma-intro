# Create a design file

## 1. Creating a New Figma Design File  

1. Open **Figma** in your web browser (https://www.figma.com/) or launch the **Figma Desktop App**.  
2. Log in with your Figma account. If you don’t have one, create a free account.  
3. On the **Figma Home** screen, click on the **New Design File** button.  
4. A blank Figma file will open in a new tab.  
5. Right now, your file doesn’t have a name. Click on **"Untitled"** in the top left corner, type **"Figma Intro Workshop"**, and press **Enter** to save this as the filename.

## 2. Setting the Page Background Color  

By default, Figma has a near-white canvas background. Let’s change that.  

1. Ensure that **nothing is selected** on the canvas. Click on an empty space in the workspace.  
2. In the **Right Sidebar**, locate the **Page** section under **Design**.  
3. Click on the **color box** to open the color picker.  
4. Make sure **Hex** is selected in the dropdown menu.  
5. In the input field, type **#D8C3A5** and press **Enter** to apply the background color.  
6. Your canvas background should now match the selected color.
